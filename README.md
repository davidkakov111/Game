My_2D_game

This is the first larger-scale 2D game that I've created, written in Python programing language, using the Arcade game developer module. This game turned out to be quite large, but I believe it was worth the invested energy because it has become a very enjoyable game! In this game you are the main character, a businessman, who tries to collect bitcoins throughout the challenges of the game, guarded by animals and other dangerous creatures. These entities inflict damage upon contact, so it's better to avoid them to prevent any fatal consequences. But don't forget to collect the bitcoins that these entities guard, because if you successfully gather all 20 bitcoins, I'll reward you with a heartfelt thank you! I wish you a pleasant gaming experience!
